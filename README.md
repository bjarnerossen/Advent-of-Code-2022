# Advent-of-Code-2022 🎄🧝

Welcome to my repository for this years [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)! 

Advent of Code is a 25-day Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets 
and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. I chose to solve the challenges in Python3 in order to hone on my Python3 skills.
