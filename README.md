# Advent of Code 2022 🎄🧝

Welcome to my repository for this years [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)! 

Advent of Code is a 25-day Advent calendar, consisting of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets 
and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. 

For this year, I chose to solve the puzzles in Python3.

## Files

```
dayXX/
├─ main.py
├─ input.txt
```

## Run the code 🦌

To run the code of a specific day from the root directory run the following, replacing `XX` with the day number, `01` - `25`.

```
python3 dayXX/main.py
```
