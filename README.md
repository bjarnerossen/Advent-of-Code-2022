# Advent-of-Code-2022 🎄🧝

Welcome to my repository for this years [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)! 

Advent of Code is a 25-day Advent calendar, consisting of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets 
and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. 

I chose to solve the challenges in Python3, in order to hone on my Python3 skills.

## Files
```
dayN/
├─ main.py
├─ input.txt
```
## Running the code
To run the code of a specific day from the root directory run the following, replacing `xx` with the day number, `01` - `25`. 

```
python3 dayxx/main.py
```
